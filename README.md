# Bookstore Management System

## Overview

The **Bookstore Management System** is a command-line application written in C++ designed to help users manage a bookstore's inventory. It provides functionalities to add new books, find existing books by their ISBN, and display the entire inventory, making it an effective tool for small bookstores or educational projects.

## Objectives

- **Inventory Management**: To develop a system that allows users to efficiently manage book inventory, ensuring that all relevant information about each book is easily accessible and modifiable.
  
- **User Interaction**: To create a user-friendly command-line interface that facilitates interaction with the system through a simple menu-driven approach.

- **Data Integrity**: To implement checks that prevent duplicate entries and ensure that the quantity of existing books is updated correctly when new stock is added.

- **Search Functionality**: To enable users to quickly find books by their ISBN, allowing for efficient inventory management.

## Features

- **Add New Books**: Users can input details of new books, including title, author, ISBN, quantity, and price. If a book with the same ISBN is already in the inventory, its quantity will be updated instead of adding a duplicate entry.
  
- **Search Books**: Users can search for books by their ISBN. If found, the book's details will be displayed; if not, an appropriate message will be shown.

- **Display Inventory**: The application can list all books in the inventory, providing details such as title, author, ISBN, quantity, and price.
